## Introduction
Deadlock Guardian is a comprehensive simulation tool designed to demonstrate and analyze deadlock detection and avoidance in operating systems using the Banker's Algorithm. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of process scheduling and resource allocation strategies, with a focus on maintaining system safety and preventing deadlocks.

## Project Description
The Deadlock Guardian simulator allows users to input or generate system states, run the Banker's Algorithm, and analyze the results. It provides insights into safe states, potential deadlocks, and resource allocation strategies in multi-process environments.
