## Introduction
Deadlock Guardian is a comprehensive simulation tool designed to demonstrate and analyze deadlock detection and avoidance in operating systems using the Banker's Algorithm. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of process scheduling and resource allocation strategies, with a focus on maintaining system safety and preventing deadlocks.

## Project Description
The Deadlock Guardian simulator allows users to input or generate system states, run the Banker's Algorithm, and analyze the results. It provides insights into safe states, potential deadlocks, and resource allocation strategies in multi-process environments.

## Usage
- Resource Allocation Simulation: The project can be used to simulate and analyze resource allocation scenarios in operating systems or distributed computing environments, helping to prevent deadlocks.
- Educational Tool: It serves as an excellent educational tool for teaching and understanding the Banker's Algorithm and concepts of deadlock prevention in computer science courses.
- System Design Planning: Software architects and system designers can use this tool to plan and verify resource allocation strategies in complex systems before implementation.

## Features and Specifications
- Multi-resource Support: Highlight that the DeadLock Guardian can handle multiple types of resources simultaneously, simulating real-world scenarios where processes require various resources.
- Flexible Input Methods: Mention the various input methods supported (e.g., user input, file input, random generation) and provide examples of the file format for input data.
- Comprehensive Reporting: Describe the detailed reports generated by the system, including execution time, memory usage, system state matrices, and the option to save reports to a file for further analysis.
